# Assignment Dashboard Fixes - Changelog

## Overview
Fixed the Student Dashboard loading issue and improved the assignment management system to properly handle real-time updates and file submissions.

## Files Changed

### 1. `lib/firebase/firestore.ts`
**Changes:**
- Added error handling to `listenToAssignments()` function with optional `onError` callback
- Added error handling to `listenToSubmissions()` function with optional `onError` callback
- Both functions now properly handle Firestore errors and pass them to the UI

**Why:** The original listeners didn't have error handling, which could cause the dashboard to get stuck in loading state if Firestore queries failed.

### 2. `app/dashboard/student/page.tsx`
**Changes:**
- Fixed loading state management by tracking both assignments and submissions loading separately
- Added proper error handling for both Firestore listeners with user-friendly toast notifications
- Added "No assignments yet" empty state with helpful messaging
- Improved loading completion logic to ensure UI updates when both data sources are loaded

**Why:** The dashboard was getting stuck on "Loading assignments..." because the loading state was only set to false in the submissions listener, not the assignments listener.

### 3. `app/api/upload/route.ts`
**Changes:**
- Fixed Firebase Storage initialization by using the imported `storage` instance instead of calling `getStorage()` again
- Removed unused `getStorage` import

**Why:** The upload API was creating a new storage instance instead of using the configured one, which could cause configuration issues.

### 4. `lib/utils/testData.ts` (New File)
**Changes:**
- Created utility functions for adding test assignments to Firestore
- Includes a sample assignment with 3 questions about object-oriented programming
- Can be used via browser console for testing: `window.createTestAssignment()`

**Why:** Provides an easy way to add test data for development and testing purposes.

### 5. `app/dashboard/student/page.tsx` (Updated - Demo Data Fallback)
**Changes:**
- Added `DEMO_ASSIGNMENTS` constant with 3 sample assignments (Math, Physics, CS)
- Added `isShowingDemoData` state to track when demo data is being displayed
- Modified assignments listener to show demo data when no real assignments exist
- Added demo badges and indicators throughout the UI
- Disabled submit functionality for demo assignments with appropriate messaging
- Updated stats section to show demo indicators and realistic demo numbers

**Why:** Provides a better user experience by showing sample data instead of empty states, while clearly marking it as demo data to avoid confusion.

### 6. Removed Files (Fitness-related cleanup)
**Files Deleted:**
- `app/split-builder/page.tsx` - Fitness split builder page
- `components/dashboard/QuickLog.tsx` - Quick workout logging component
- `components/dashboard/SplitSummary.tsx` - Workout split summary component
- `components/dashboard/StreakCard.tsx` - Fitness streak tracking component
- `components/dashboard/WorkoutCalendar.tsx` - Workout calendar component
- `lib/utils/streak.ts` - Fitness streak utility functions

**Why:** These files were part of the original fitness tracking app and are no longer needed for the Acadex assignment management system.

### 7. Teacher Dashboard Files Updated
**Files Modified:**
- `lib/firebase/firestore.ts` - Added `createAssignment` and `listenToTeacherAssignments` functions
- `lib/types/index.ts` - Added `createdBy` field to Assignment interface
- `app/assignments/create/page.tsx` - Updated to use Firestore directly with proper auth
- `app/dashboard/teacher/page.tsx` - Added real-time listeners and demo data fallback

**Why:** These changes enable proper assignment creation and real-time updates in the teacher dashboard.

### 8. Firestore Robustness Files Updated
**Files Modified:**
- `lib/firebase/firestore.ts` - Added robust query handling with fallbacks and error handling
- `lib/types/index.ts` - Added `totalQuestions` field to Assignment interface
- `app/dashboard/student/page.tsx` - Updated demo data with new fields
- `app/dashboard/teacher/page.tsx` - Updated demo data with new fields
- `lib/utils/testData.ts` - Updated test data with new fields
- `lib/utils/firestoreDebug.ts` - Added debug utilities for troubleshooting

**Why:** These changes prevent Firestore assertion errors and make the system more robust against query failures.

   ```

2. **Test Teacher Dashboard:**
   - Login as a teacher
   - Click "+Create Assignment" 
   - Fill out the form and create an assignment
   - Verify the assignment appears instantly in "Assignments Overview"
   - Check that no Firestore errors occur in browser console

3. **Test Student Dashboard:**
   - Login as a student
   - View assignments in the dashboard
   - Click "Submit" on an assignment
   - Upload a PDF file
   - Verify the submission appears in "Recent Submissions"
   - Check that the assignment status updates to "Submitted"

4. **Debug Firestore Issues (if needed):**
   - Open browser console
   - Run: `window.debugFirestore.assignments()` to check assignments collection
   - Run: `window.debugFirestore.submissions()` to check submissions collection
   - Run: `window.debugFirestore.teacherAssignments('your-teacher-id')` to test teacher queries

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Firestore Security Rules:** Implement proper security rules to restrict access based on user roles
2. **File Download Security:** Add authentication checks for file downloads
3. **Assignment Filtering:** Implement class-based assignment filtering for students
4. **Teacher Dashboard:** Complete the teacher dashboard for creating and managing assignments

6. **Notifications:** Add email/push notifications for assignment deadlines and grades

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard stuck on "Loading assignments..."

- Verify Firebase configuration is correct
- Ensure user is authenticated
- Check Firestore security rules allow read access

### File upload fails
- Verify Firebase Storage is properly configured
- Check file size (max 10MB) and type (PDF only)
- Ensure user has write permissions to Storage

### Real-time updates not working
- Check Firestore listeners are properly set up
- Verify `onSnapshot` callbacks are being called
- Check for JavaScript errors in browser console
